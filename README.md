# Steps to Push Files to GitHub

1. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory of your project. You can use the `cd` command to change directories.

```
cd path/to/your/project
```

2. **Initialize a Git Repository (if not already done)**: If you haven't initialized a Git repository in your project folder, you can do so by running:

```
git init
```

3. **Add Your Files**: To stage your files for commit, use the following command:

```
git add .
```

4. **Commit Your Changes**: After staging your files, you need to commit them with a message. Use the following command:

```
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
```

5. **Add the Remote Repository**: If you haven't linked your local repository to a remote GitHub repository, you need to do that. Use the following command, replacing `YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL` with the URL of your GitHub repository:

```
git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL
```

You can find the URL of your repository on GitHub, usually in the format `https://github.com/username/repository.git`.


6. **Push Your Changes**: Finally, push your changes to the GitHub repository using:

```
git push -u origin main
or
git push -u origin master
```

If your default branch is named something other than main (like master), replace main with the appropriate branch name.

# GitHub Commands

#### Hereâ€™s a summary of the commands you might run:

```
cd path/to/your/project
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Additional Notes

* If you are pushing to a repository for the first time, you may be prompted to enter your GitHub username and password (or a personal access token if you have two-factor authentication enabled).

* If you encounter any errors during the push (like "rejected" errors), it may be due to changes in the remote repository. You may need to pull the latest changes first using `git pull origin main` and then push again.

* If you are using SSH instead of HTTPS, the remote URL will look like `git@github.com:username/repository.git`.
